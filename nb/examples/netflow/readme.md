# Netflow example

Run notebooks in this order:

1. `pmap.ipynb` to generate the probability map from a CMD simulation.
2. `observations.ipynb` to assign priorities, calculate required exposure time and generate the input target list from the observations
3. `targets.ipynb` to plot the input target lists including the photometric data, the flux standards and the sky positions
4. `netflow.ipynb` to solve the netflow problem
