# Target selection utilities for PFS Galactic Archeology

Authors: L치szl칩 Dobos (JHU), Evan Kirby (ND) with a lot of contibutions from the PFS team.

This library contains various tools for selecting targets for the PFS Galactic Archeology survey and design fiber assignments for the Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS) using the network flow algorithm.

The netflow code is closely based on the work of Maximillian Fabricius, Martin Reineke and the PFS team.

The library depends on the various PFS software developed by the PFS team. These can be found at https://github.com/Subaru-PFS

The library depends on the Isochrones library written by L치szl칩 Dobos and can be found at https://github.com/Subaru-PFS-GA/ga_isochrones. The Isochrones library is a close adaption of the isochone table interpolation algorithm of Timothy D. Morton based on Equivalent Evolutionary Phases (EEP) developed for the Dartmouth and MIST isochrone libraries (Dotter et al.).
